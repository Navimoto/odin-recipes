    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>14 oz water</li>
            <li>3 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil <em>(use a good one!)</em></li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 jar pizza sauce</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer* fitted with the dough hook attachment combine the water, yeast and honey and let sit for 10 minutes until the yeast is floating at the top and looks foamy. Add in the flour and olive oil and stir to combine thoroughly, you don’t want any dry bits of flour.</li>
            <li>Cover with a damp hand towel and let sit for 10 minutes. Add in the salt and run the mixer on medium high for 10 minutes or until the dough is sticking to the bottom of the bowl and slapping the sides. It should not be sticking to the sides of the bowl at the end of the 10 minutes. If it’s sticking to the sides, add flour in 1 tablespoon increments. The dough should be smooth, soft, pliable and elastic; it will also be quite damp. Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil and place the dough in there, turning once to make sure the topside has a light coating of olive oil.</li>
            <li>At this point, you can A) let the dough rise at room temp until double in size (about 2 hours) and proceed with the recipe; B) stash in an air-tight container in the fridge for the day and pull it out that evening when ready to use or; C) cover tightly and stash in the fridge overnight and up to 2 days.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 500F (260C) and place a pizza stone, pizza steel or inverted, level baking sheet on the center rack of the oven. I like to preheat my oven for at least 1 hour prior to making pizza. Set your pizza sauce out on the counter to come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Equally divide the pizza dough up depending on how many pizzas you want to make (3-6). Roll each piece of the divided dough into a tight, compact ball. Set on a lightly floured surface and lightly dust the tops with flour. Lay a clean hand towel over the top. Let rest for about 30 to 60 minutes or until the dough is no longer cool to the touch; may take longer depending on ambient temperature.</li>
            <li>Once they are no longer cool, gently stretch the dough into pizza rounds. Cut sheets of parchment paper the size of each pizza dough round, lightly dust with flour and set the dough on top. The parchment makes it easier to get the pizzas in and out of the oven.</li>
            <li>Cover each pizza in a light coating of pizza sauce, cover with some cheese (not too much), the mushroom and onion mixture, kale and whatever toppings make you happy (I like to add a little more cheese on top) and then bake in the center of the oven for about 10 minutes. Some ovens will take a minute or two less (a pizza oven will only take about 3 minutes), some ovens a minute or two more. You want there to be some dark charred spots on the top of the crust and the bottom should be firm and crispy (see note). Let sit for 3 minutes (this lets the cheese set a bit) and then cut and serve!</li>
