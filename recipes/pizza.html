    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>14 oz water</li>
            <li>3 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil <em>(use a good one!)</em></li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>1 jar pizza sauce</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer* fitted with the dough hook attachment combine the water, yeast and honey and let sit for 10 minutes until the yeast is floating at the top and looks foamy. Add in the flour and olive oil and stir to combine thoroughly, you don’t want any dry bits of flour.</li>
            <li>Cover with a damp hand towel and let sit for 10 minutes. Add in the salt and run the mixer on medium high for 10 minutes or until the dough is sticking to the bottom of the bowl and slapping the sides. It should not be sticking to the sides of the bowl at the end of the 10 minutes. If it’s sticking to the sides, add flour in 1 tablespoon increments. The dough should be smooth, soft, pliable and elastic; it will also be quite damp. Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil and place the dough in there, turning once to make sure the topside has a light coating of olive oil.</li>
            <li>At this point, you can A) let the dough rise at room temp until double in size (about 2 hours) and proceed with the recipe; B) stash in an air-tight container in the fridge for the day and pull it out that evening when ready to use or; C) cover tightly and stash in the fridge overnight and up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
